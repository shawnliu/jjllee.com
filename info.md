From her studio in Brooklyn, Judy paints the American city: quiet ordinary stretches of skies, buildings, trees. 


Judy has a Visual Arts Minor from Columbia University (and a major in political science). She briefly attended the graduate program at The Surrey Institute of Art and Design in London and studied painting at the School of Visual Arts. After working in education, design, and fashion, in 2011 she began painting full-time. In 2012, her first year showing her work, Judy’s paintings were included in nationally renowned juried exhibitions in New York and Pennsylvania.

She lives and works in Brooklyn with her husband and two sons.
